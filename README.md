# Landing-page

## Purpose
Project from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) set out to challenge its participants to more or less duplicate [this image](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) using CSS3 Flexbox.

## Live Version
- https://mogoatlhe.github.io/landing-page/

## Challenges Encountered
- Nothing challenging yet, mostly because I used the [Flexbox exercises](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises/tree/main/flex) in Foundation to practice prior to starting the challenge. 100//
